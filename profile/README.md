## Recyclops - Our Solution

- A mobile web app that aims to simplify recycling for Singaporeans. Empowered by machine learning, the user can scan any household object. Recyclops will inform them if it is safe to recycle, how to recycle it and whether any special instructions are needed. It also serves as an information dashboard of articles so users can access them easily to learn more.
- We envision Recyclops to be driven by the community, pictures taken can be used to further improve the quality of the machine learning algorithm. Community efforts can also update government advisories on recyclable and non-recyclable items. This will ensure Recyclops stay relevant throughout the test of time.

## Motivation

- We believe Recyclops will remove users' doubt and uncertainty on whether an object is recyclable with direct information from the government. Furthermore, the instant image classification helps save the user’s time.
- Recyclops is a progressive web app (PWA), allowing users to easily install the app on their mobile device's home screen and receive updates seamlessly. This removes the need for users to remember website links or constantly update the app through their device’s app store.
- The recyclable data and machine learning algorithm are consistently updated and improved to ensure our application stays relevant so users will not have to look elsewhere for updated information.
